You are now going to evaluate the users' chatting. The thing is, the rules for evaluating the user's chatting are also customizable. And, also if the user's chatting is violating the rule, you should give 1. why is this text violating the rule, and 2. a suggestion that has a similar meaning and both obey the rules. The list of 1. user's chatting and 2. the custom rules would be given as input. You should give an list of output in the format of the JSON file. JSON file format should be {isError: false, reason: what rules user violated, suggestions: two alternative suggestions that can replace the original chat. It should've similar meanings and both obeys the rules}. NO additional explanation is required.

First, isError should be always false if you get the input correctly. For the reason part, if the chat doesn't violate any rules, leave it as '-'. For the suggestion part, if  the reason is '-', leave it as '-'. Remember that the output should be only the JSON file, and the JSON file should follow the format.

If more than one inputs come in,  just output the list of JSON files WITHOUT indexing.

For example,
rules: ["No abusive words.", "No sexual harassment.", "Every chat should be related to baseball."]
Input:
["He is absolutely trash!", "Women shouldn't do the baseball.", "Let's talk soccer, not the boring baseball.", "Who won this game?"]
Output:
[
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "abusive word 'trash' is detected",
"suggestions": "He is not doing well on this game."
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "sexual harassment detected",
"suggestions": "Everyone can enjoy baseball."
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "every chat should be related to baseball",
"suggestions": "Let's talk about some baseball things."
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "-",
"suggestions": "-"
}
]

For another example, 
Rules:
["No abusive words.", "No racial harassment.", "Every chat should be related to computer science or computer science courses.", "No writings that can cause controversy related to politics.", "No cheating on test or assignments.", "Don't pretend to know someone else who is anonymous."]
Input:
["We only need more female students, not male.", "This professor is so dumb. TA's are also dumbass.", "Do you know where the 'Programming Language' course's class?", "Anyone please give me answers with this 'Molecular Biology' lecture?", "Why are there so many Europeans in this Class?", "I think we should pick him in this election because he said that he would give us more money on R&D.", "Please help me with this "Operative System" assignment. I'll give 30$.", "Hey, Brian what do you think you are doing?"]
Output:
[
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "gender discrimination detected",
"suggestions": ["We need more diversity in computer science students.", "We should encourage participation from all genders in computer science."]
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "abusive words detected",
"suggestions": ["This professor's teaching method could be improved.", "I find the course instruction challenging."]
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "-",
"suggestions": "-"
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "not related to computer science or computer science courses",
"suggestions": ["Can someone help me understand this computer science assignment?", "I need guidance on solving this programming problem."]
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "racial harassment detected",
"suggestions": ["I'm curious about the diversity in our class.", "What are the backgrounds of students in this computer science course?"]
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "political controversy detected",
"suggestions": ["Let's discuss technical aspects of research funding.", "What are some innovative research strategies in computer science?"]
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "potential academic dishonesty and cheating",
"suggestions": ["Could someone explain the problem-solving approach for this assignment?", "I'm looking for study resources to help me understand the assignment."]
},
{
"isError": false,
"reason": "pretending to know an anonymous person",
"suggestions": ["Is anyone available to help me?", "Could someone provide guidance?"]
}
]

I'll now give you an input. Please give me an output.
